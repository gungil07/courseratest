    <h2>About Me & This Site</h2>
<p>My scientific journey began with fundamental questions: Why do we live? What are life and death? What are diseases, and how can they be cured? Over time, my career has focused on understanding how immune deviation occurs in the anterior chamber, how the brain (neurons) and retina (photoreceptors) develop and function, and how the immune system influences both the brain and retina. I majored in immunology and neurobiology and worked as a basic scientist at the National Eye Institute. </p>
<br>

<p>Later, my path evolved into translational R&D as a scientist in Nanomedicine and Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University, and in Pharmaceutics at the School of Pharmacy, Virginia Commonwealth University. There, I concentrated on translational efficacy studies, including biodistribution and drug maintenance at the academic R&D level. </p>
<br>
<p>This passion eventually led me to the biotech industry, particularly in gene and delivery research, focusing on exosomes and AAV therapeutic development. I remain fascinated by the interplay of food and medicine, and the principles of self vs. non-self in immunology. More recently, I have been challenging myself to explore gene and protein engineering, applying/learning cutting-edge AI technologies to develop the next generation of medicines.</p>
</br>
<p>I deeply value the culture of free learning and innovation in the U.S., as well as the power of collaboration and networking across different fields and generations.</p>
<br>
<p>This is my first GitHub Pages site, which I will use to learn, practice, and experiment with computer-related projects.</p>
